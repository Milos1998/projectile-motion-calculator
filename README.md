# projectile-motion-calculator
Scripts that calculate projectile motion at angled shot.
First one takes in consideration only gravitational force.
Second one takes in consideration air resistance.
Third one is rocket simulator, it takes in consideration both pervious factors and has fuel tank and engine.

Graphs are ploted using `matplotlib`, so run with any tool that can display GUI. I've used `spyder`.
